<strong>Who is this program for and what it entails?</strong><br>
This program is aimed at students, small businesses, and any aspiring & passionate person who wishes to start out in this industry and/or develop their ideas into a collection/business. The program provides the knowledge, skills, insight and exposure to the industry essential for practical development & experience in the fashion and textile industry, that otherwise would not be provided at colleges, universities and workshops. The program can act as a next stage of development to a college or university fashion/textile course, however you do not need any fashion/textile background to enrol. This program is therefore also aimed at those who have passion and ambition to enter and progress in the fashion and textile industry but do not wish to go through a very lengthy and costly college or university course.  
<br><br>
<strong>What is the age restriction?</strong><br>
You must be 18 years or over to participate in this program.
<br><br>
<strong>Who’s the course provider?</strong><br>
Estox Connect (trading under Adam and Alice ltd), member of ASBCI (Association of Suppliers to the British Clothing Industry) and London Chamber of Commerce, is an industry leading fashion & textile supply chain management company with presence based in both UK and India - specialising in woven and knits, managing operations right from design management, order processing sampling/prototyping to manufacturing, quality inspection and lead time management.

<br><br>
<strong>Can I participate in one of the modules or do I have to attend all of them?</strong><br>
You can choose to attend only module 1 or module 2 independently. However to attend module 3, it is mandatory that you complete module 1 first.

Yes, the required course materials and module pre-requisite instructions will be given before the start of each module.

Yes, in Module 1 the program is designed to teach you the fundamentals of fashion & textile technologies combined with the essential practical skills for designing collections/prototypes/initial products through to a final marketable brand, while in parallel applying all this to your own ideas/designs, through a product life cycle approach. Module 3 will continue from module 1, and is purely dedicated to building your own products/collection and developing your brand, where you will take your initial ideas & designs and develop them to more industry accepted designs, sampling/prototype, manufacturing and finally to a finished brand (collection of products), which you will present and pitch in front of retail buyers, all under our guidance during the course program.

<h4>Module 1 FAQ</h4>
<strong>What is the module duration and schedule of class sessions?</strong><br>
This module duration is 24 hours, which will be divided over a period of 8 class sessions (8 days). This is scheduled over weekends on both Saturdays and Sundays with 3 hours per day (1 class session). Hence the module is scheduled to be completed over a period of 1 month. However, please bear in mind this is the target schedule, and the schedule times may vary for flexibility to accommodate for various circumstances subject to tutor and student availability and any other unforeseen circumstances.  
<br><br>
<strong>What are the requirements to participate in this module?</strong><br>
A background in fashion and textile would be desirable but not essential. As long as you demonstrate a strong passion and ambition to progress in the fashion & textile industry, this will be sufficient to participate in this program.  
<br><br>
<strong>What apparels and textile technologies does the module cover?</strong><br>
The module aims to cover mainly woven and knits technologies. It does not cover all the technologies used in fashion and textile, but suitable solutions may be given either by the experts of those technologies or after consulting with the experts of those technologies.
<br><br>
<strong>What if I want to take leave or am unable to attend certain classes?</strong><br>
We allow a maximum of two missed class sessions (equivalent to 25% of the course attendance). We have to be informed a minimum of 24 hours in advance of the class date & time for any absence to take place. Those who miss a class session, a catch up session over Skype can be arranged.

<br><br>
</p>
<p>
<h4>Module 2 FAQ</h4>
<strong>What is the module duration and schedule?</strong><br>
The duration of this module will be a week visit to a major garment & textile manufacturing region in India. This visit will be arranged and agreed in cohorts of students for each visit. This will help make the trip more beneficial and organised for the group.
<br><br>
<strong>What are the requirements to participate in this module?</strong><br>
A background in fashion and textile would be desirable but not essential. As long as you demonstrate a strong passion and ambition to progress in the fashion & textile industry, this will be sufficient to participate in this module.  
<br><br>
<strong>Where will I be travelling to visit these factories?</strong><br>
You will be travelling to Tiruppur, known as the "knitwear capital" of India. It has spurred up the textile industry in India for the past three decades. It contributes to a huge amount of foreign exchange in India. The city exports Rs. 120 billion worth of goods. Netaji Apparel Park has 53 companies manufacturing knitwear for exports. Each unit will be a model to answer the requirements of international standards in all aspects. In addition to investment of INR 920 million on infrastructure and factory buildings about INR 3 billion is being invested on machinery (source wikipedia). More information can be found about the place at this link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiruppur
<br><br>
<strong>What will I be doing in the visit?</strong><br>
Accompanied by an expert in the industry who will also act as the guide of your group, you will visit factories and manufacturers that work with the course provider institution, to gain first-hand insight into the processes and operations that take place in the factories. This will be a unique, invaluable experience and exposure for students to bolster their knowledge and understanding of manufacturing various apparel and textile products as well as pre and post manufacturing processes.
<br><br>
<strong>What will be included in the module package?</strong><br>
The fee for this module will be for industry visit placement of 1 week. This will include lift from the airport to the accommodation. Lifts from your accommodation and back, to the factories you will be visiting on daily basis, by the industry expert who will also act as your guide for the entire week placement, guiding and teaching you throughout the factories’ daily visits.
The fee will not include flights, accommodations, food and other expenditures (not mentioned above). You will therefore need to arrange for your visa, flights and accommodation for the trip. We can assist in providing you with a list of recommended accommodations in convenient locations in the area if required, to help ensure you have the best experience possible. We can also assist on flights, which destination airport is best to fly to and any other useful information you might need. As such, we hope you understand that we’re not a travel agency, but we will do what we can to assist you on your trip and have a great experience.        
<br><br>
<strong>What do I get at the end of this module?</strong><br>
