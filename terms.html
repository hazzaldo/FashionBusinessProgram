          	HIS TRAINING AGREEMENT (i.e. “Agreement”) is entered into upon execution between ESTOX CONNECT d/b/a/ ADAM & ALICE, LTD., a duly registered Limited Company (i.e. “Company”, “We”, “Us”, “Our”) and the STUDENT (“Student”, “You”, “Your”).  For valuable consideration the parties agree to the following terms and conditions:<br>
<br>
1. NATURE AND PURPOSE.  Our Company has created a unique and proprietary training program for students aspiring to enter into the fashion and textile industry. Coursework emphasis is on manufacturing and business operations, including but not limited to hands-on training. <br>
<br>
Our Program is divided into Three distinct and separate Modules: Module #1: Textile and Fashion Fundamentals; Module #2: Manufacturing; and Module #3: Fashion business project and Buyers Den. See our Course Brochure prior to registering for a Module, or contact our company for additional information.<br>
<br>
2. TRAINING PROGRAM AND FEES.  The Fashion and Textile Business Training Program shall include training and instruction in the following areas:
(a) History of Textile Manufacturing; (b) Types of Textile Manufacturing Equipment and Operations; (c) Styles and Types of Textiles; (d) Manufacturing Processes; (e) Textile Business Operations; (f) Product Design, Branding, Networking and Sales.<br>
<br>
Courses are limited to a total of five (5) students (however this number may increase in the future), and will begin at the scheduled date and time based upon availability. For Module #1, Students are permitted to miss a total of two (2) sessions.  Makeup sessions provided on a limited basis. (See Clause #5). 
Scheduled times and dates for Modules may change as needed. Advance notice will be provided to Students in the event of any session modification.<br>
<br>
The Training Program Fees and Payment Terms are as follows: Program Fee is due and payable in advance in order to reserve your space for the class, within 15 days of the scheduled start date and time for each Module. We only accept Direct Debit transfer payment. <br>
<br>
<strong>MODULE #1:</strong>  Textile and Fashion Fundamentals.  Program Fee:  £ 1500 + VAT.
(Basics suited to beginners and small business. Students must attend all classes to receive Certificate of Completion.)
In section 3 - CAD design: Computer Aided Designing (using Adobe illustrator and photoshop) (6 hrs) - note: a pre-requisite of this module is the Student must have Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop software installed on his/her computer in order to practice and apply his/her learning from the instructor. The Company will not provide Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop software to the Student. Therefore it is the student’s responsibility to ensure both Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop software are both installed on his/her computer from the student’s own expense.  <br>
<br>

The fee will NOT include flights, accommodations, food and other expenditures (not mentioned above). You will therefore need to arrange for your visa, flights, accommodation separately, and also allocate sufficient spending money for food and other necessities for the trip. We can assist in providing you with a list of recommended accommodations in convenient locations in the area if required, to help ensure you have the best experience possible. We can also assist on flights, which destination airport is best to fly to and any other useful information you might need. Travel insurance is NOT included, so it is highly recommended that you have travel insurance arranged. See course brochure or catalog for more information. Travel and Liability Waiver is required to be signed upon registering for this Module. An itinerary and guide will be provided prior to your trip to assist in providing you with as much knowledge to prepare you for the trip. As such, we hope you understand that we’re not a travel agency, but we will do what we can to assist you on your trip, to have a safe and great experience.<br>
<br>
<strong>MODULE #3:</strong> Networking and Sales.  Program Fee:  £ 1000 + VAT.  **Program fee is for training only. (Interaction and networking with retailers or/and industry experts.

<br>
3.  CANCELLATIONS.  (a) Company.  If for any reason a class session must be cancelled by the Company, advance notice will be provided to the student either via: email; text; or phone call.
