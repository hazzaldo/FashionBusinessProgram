# FashionBusinessProgram

Fashion Business Program is a project I co-founded with a fashion design and textile manufacturing experienced professional and colleague. 
Its concept is a fashion business accelerator program to help fashion design aspirers to have a complete program that takes them from the fundamentals and theory of fashion design, getting first hand insight into textile sourcing and manufacturing, all the way to a final made product(s) ready to pitch to investors. The program is split into 3 modules:
+ FASHION & TEXTILE FUNDAMENTALS - THEORY & PRACTICAL
+ INDUSTRY EXPOSURE TO FACTORIES (ABROAD) - industry visit (exposure to apparel & textile factories abroad in India). 
+ BUYERS DEN - Final project & pitching your brand/label to retail buyers. 

I co-designed and wrote the content of the website, and I developed the website myself using HTML, CSS, JS and Bootstrap.
